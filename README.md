One Box At A Time is a Quilt mod *exclusively* for Minecraft snapshot 22w13oneblockatatime, the april fools snapshot for 2022.
It adds cardboard boxes which can store up to nine blocks. To fill the box, place blocks above it and then right-click it with empty arms.
The box is crafted with four planks and one stick.

The mod also adds support for pressing the drop key to throw blocks or entities from any distance! Have fun!

NOTE: I've included a fabric.mod.json in the root if you would like to try and run it on Fabric.
**This may not work, and will not be supported.**
